- 👋 Hi, I’m @m-ulmestrand, but you can call me Mattias.
- 👀 I do a lot of Machine Learning in my spare time as well as in my studies. I'm especially interested in Graph Neural Networks. 
      I find them useful and fascinating, since a lot of physical structures can be modelled as graphs.
      I have a repository open where I have used a GCN to learn collision physics in multi-particle collisions.
      I also made a self-learning game with LSTM and Deep Q-learning, where agents learn to avoid the predator (player) in real time. 
      Another project I did features self-driving cars with Deep Q-learning and LiDAR-like detectors
      
     I would say that my favourite part of doing Machine Learning is the interplay between modelling an environment in detail and allowing the AI
     to learn from it.
      
- 🌱 I’m currently studying the Master's programme Complex Adaptive Systems at Chalmers University of Technology, 
      where I predominantly study Machine Learning and Computational science.
      Right now, I'm doing my exchange studies at ETH Zürich, where I'm studying mostly Machine Learning and Computational science
- 💞️ I’d love to collaborate on ML projects, especially with applications for physics, programming or games.
