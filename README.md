- 👋 Hi, I’m @m-ulmestrand, but you can call me Mattias.
- 👀 I do a lot of Machine Learning in my spare time as well as in my studies. I'm especially interested in Graph Neural Networks. 
      I find them useful and fascinating, since a lot of physical structures can be modelled as graphs.
      I have a repository open where I have used a GCN to learn collision physics in multi-particle collisions.
      I also made a self-learning game with LSTM and Deep Q-learning, where agents learn to avoid the predator (player) in real time. 
      Another project I did features self-driving cars with Deep Q-learning and LiDAR-like detectors
      
- 🌱 I’m currently studying the Master's programme Complex Adaptive Systems at Chalmers University of Technology, 
      where I predominantly study Machine Learning and Computational engineering. 
      Right now, I'm doing my exchange studies at ETH Zürich, where I'm continuing with the same profile.
      
      Having a background in both Computational engineering and ML, I like to do projects where I get to combine the modelling-intensive character
      of Computational engineering and the data-centred approach of ML. 
- 💞️ I’d love to collaborate on ML projects, especially with applications for physics, programming or games.
